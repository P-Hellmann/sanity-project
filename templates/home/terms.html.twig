        <h2>Terms</h2>
        <p>By purchasing from Sanity Shop, you agree to the following spooky terms of service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We cannot guarantee that our products will ward off angry spirits, vengeful ghosts, or overly curious
                poltergeists—but hey, they might help!
            </li>
            <li>Sanity Shop is not responsible for any ectoplasmic messes, sudden chills, or furniture moving on its own
                while using our products.
            </li>
            <li>Please do not attempt to eat, burn, or summon entities with our products unless explicitly stated in the
                instructions.
            </li>
            <li>Our protective items are designed to provide peace of mind but may not work on demons, banshees, or
                ancient curses created before 1700 AD.
            </li>
            <li>In the unlikely event of a full-blown haunting, please contact your local ghostbuster or exorcist—we are
                just a shop, not supernatural experts.
            </li>
            <li>Sanity Shop reserves the right to change prices, summon better deals, or update these terms without
                consulting the spirit realm.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember to proceed with caution and have fun! If you have concerns, feel free to scream (or just contact
            us).</p>
